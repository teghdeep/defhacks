        Def Hacks is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit that hosts international hackathons.
        Def Hacks Learn is a program designed to both give students the tools
        they need to succeed in hackathons and get acquainted with computer
        science. <br />
        <br />
        Around the world, there are massive gaps in access to computer science
        education. We believe that closing this gap will allow everyone to have
        the tools they need to build a successful future. <br /> <br /> That’s
        why Learn is working to level out the playing field for underrepresented
        communites by creating a free, project-based online curriculum that
        anyone can learn from.
